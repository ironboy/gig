# Long way home (Tom Waits) D + capo 2?

Well I stumbled in the darkness
Lost and alone
Though I said I'd go before us
And show the way back home
Is there a light up ahead?
I can't hold on very long
Forgive me pretty baby but I always take the long way home

Money's just something you throw
Off the back of a train
Got a handful of lightening
A hatful of rain
And I know that I said
I'd never do it again
And I love you pretty baby but I always take the long way home

I put food on the table
And a roof overhead
But I'd trade it all tomorrow
For the highway instead
Watch your back if I should tell you
Love's the only thing I've ever known
One thing for sure pretty baby - I always take the long way home

You know I love you baby
More than the whole wide world
You are my woman
I know you are my pearl
Let's go out past the party lights
We can finally be alone
Come with me and we can take the long way home

Come with me, together we can take the long way home
Come with me, together we can take the long way home
