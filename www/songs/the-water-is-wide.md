The Water is Wide (trad.) ?

The water is wide
I can not get o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Show me a bark that will carry two
And o'er shall both my love and I

There is a ship that sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I felt
I know not if I'll sink or swim

For love is handsome and love is fine
And love's a jewel while it's new
But when it is old it gets cold and grey
And fades away like morning dew

The water is wide
I can not get o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Show me a bark that will carry two
And o'er shall both my love and I
