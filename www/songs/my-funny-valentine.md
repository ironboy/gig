My funny valentine...
Sweet, comic valentine...
You make me smile 
with my heart

Your looks are laughable, 
unphotographable
Yet you're my 
favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak,
Are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, 
stay

Each day is valentine's day.
