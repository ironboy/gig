# Speed of the sound of loneliness (John Prine) G + capo 3?

You come home late 
and you come home early
You come on big 
when you're feeling small
You come home straight 
and you come home curly
Sometimes you don't come home at all

So what in the world's come over you
And what in heaven's name have you done
You've broken the speed of 
the sound of loneliness
You're out there running 
just to be on the run

Well I got a heart that burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Get left so far behind

So what in the world's come over you...

It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
That's crossed the evil line today
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow
We we ain't got one word left to say

So what in the world's come over you...

*ending x 3*
You're out there running 
just to be on the run
