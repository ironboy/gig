#King of the road (Roger Miller) G + capo 3

* Gl√∂m inte basintrot.*

Trailers for sale or rent,
rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets,
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah, but, two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means, 
I'm king of the road

Third boxcar, midnight train, 
destination Bangor, Maine
Old worn-out suits and shoes
I don't pay no union dues

I smoke old stogies I have found, 
short, but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means, 
I'm king of the road

I know every engineer on every train
All their children, and all of their names
And every hand out in every town
And every door that ain't locked when no one's around

I sing:
trailers for sale or rent, 
rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets, 
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah, but, two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means, 
king of the road

Trailers for sale or rent,
rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets, 
I ain't got no cigarettes

Ah, but, two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means, 
king of the road

I'm a man of means by no means, 
I'm king of the road
